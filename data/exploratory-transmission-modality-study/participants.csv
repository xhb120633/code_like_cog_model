57,2,0,Replication,0.8514961207069099,1,"The key is to do it systematically. You will focus on each image in turn and attempt to move them as far to the left as possible, one spot at a time.

So to start, ignore the far left image, since you already can't move it any further to the left. Instead focus on the second image, and attempt to swap it with the image one place to the left of it. Regardless of whether it lets you are not, you are now done focusing on the second image, and can go on to the third.

So consider the third image. Attempt to move it one space to the left. After this will be the first time you will have to make a decision. If it lets you move the third image to the left one space, continue to attempt to move this image one space at a time until you can no longer do so. Whenever you are unable to swap it, go on to the fourth image.

Follow this pattern to the end. So for the fourth image, attempt to move it one space to the left till it no longer lets you, then move on to the fifth image. For the fifth image, do the same, one spot to the left at a time till it's no longer possible, and then finally the sixth and final image. Again move it one space to the left until no longer possible. When the image that was originally in the sixth position will no longer swap one position to the left, all the images are in the proper position.

This will get you the solution every time without guesswork, and sometimes in a relatively short amount of moves, depending on your lucky you are."

288,1,0,Demonstration,0.915124238620742,9,"I tried to work backwards and use positionality (or the end) to help with my determining. So basically work from the 6 location and see if what was there would move down. If so, then move from 5 to 4. If something moved from 4 to 5. Then check 6. This would allow me to understand if what was in the 6 location was the highest possible. If something didn't swap, then I at least new everything to the right of it was a higher number than the pair I was trying to swap."

Then We check C and D. IF they move, check the new C and B; if they move again, check the new B and A.
With E and F, do the same process, seeing if they're smaller than the one to the left and keep ""sliding"" it left until it doesn't move."

150,1,0,Demonstration,0.6266666666666667,1,"I tried to use the strategy of someone else, that is starting with the second image, and moving to the left, then the third image, moving to the left, fourth, and so on... it worked okay, it gets the job done but it may not be the most successful strategy.  "
221,1,0,Demonstration,0.6228020930118833,1,"I would start at the 2 then select 1. I would then proceed to 3, then 2. If it swapped, I would then select 2, then 1. I would keep this strategy along until the end working from right to left. If there was no swap I would not feel a need to proceed that tile and simply move onto the next number. If it moves I would move it left until it wouldn't move anymore.

For example I would use this order: 2, 1...3, 2....2, 1.....4, 3....3, 2....2, 1....5, 4...4, 3...6, 5...5, 4...4, 3...3, 2...2, 1...

167,1,0,Demonstration,0.6081333651363621,1,Compare first picture with 2nd. If they don't switch then they are in order so you compare 2nd to 3rd. If it switches then you compare the new 2nd with 1st. Now take 3rd picture and compare to 4th. You keep doing this all the way down. In this process if a picture switches then you take the newly switched and compare to the one above and keep doing that until there is no switch and then go back to the original switched position and keep working down to the end.
254,1,0,Demonstration,0.6062265017009882,1,"I started with the first image and compared it to the second image.  If the images did not switch, I went on to compare the second and third image.  When the image switched, I went backward comparing the images from before to the one I was on.  "

189,1,0,Demonstration,0.57844838921762,0,I tried using the strategy that I saw from a previous player. I tried moving them all over and to the side. I usually started with the second one.
227,1,0,Demonstration,0.5722314049586776,7,"What I did was relatively simple. I started at the left side, or the number 1 position. I would then try to switch positions 1 and 2. I would then move onto try and switch positions 2 and 3. After that positions 3 and 4. Then 4 and 5. Lastly I would switch positions 5 and 6. I would then work backwards from right to left, but instead of starting at position 6 I would start at position 5. I would compare positions 5 and 4, 4 and 3, 3 and 2, 2 and 1.

251,1,0,Demonstration,0.4747314049586776,0,"My strategy worked pretty well. I got 5 out of 8 correct, and the three I got incorrect was mostly owed to the fact that I kept forgetting to do one final check of the third square from the left. To begin, I started by selecting the square on the far left, then selecting the square on the far right to see if they would switch. They usually did not. I then selected the square on the far right and the square to its left. I then started testing the far left squares against all the squares ahead of until I got a switch. I then would check the square that switched with the ones behind it to the left and ahead of it. It was a sort of weaving technique. This is probably not the best way to go about this, but I did get okay results."

If what was first is now second or third, continue to swap successively rightwards. If what was first is now fourth, fifth, or sixth; swap successively leftwards. 

After you have swapped once with the first ordinal picture and the last picture, or you've tried the five swaps with the first picture and made no movements and have tried five swaps with the last picture and made no movements, you know the first and last picture are in their right place. Try the algorithm again with the second through the fifth, then the third through the fourth. 

This is known as DUMBSORT, and it didn't work too well as I had too many comparisons. Here's a better idea.

Given a group (a, b, c, d, e, f), try (a, f), (b, e), (c, d). Then (a, c), (b, c), (c, e). Then (d, e), (d, f). "

208,1,0,Demonstration,0.3908299490214871,1,Check for the second option if it changes you click the previous image if it didn't change go for next image
166,1,0,Demonstration,0.3849382716049382,0,I attempted to go from left to right selecting the set image and then going down the list until it did not move.
220,1,0,Demonstration,0.3825239866192526,9,I started at the beginning or end and just switched them until I couldn't one at a time.
283,1,0,Demonstration,0.3739108675427204,6,I started from the first picture and clicked on the last picture until the picture stopped moving. Then I repeated the same strategy with the second picture and then on until the pictures stopped moving.
200,1,0,Demonstration,0.3646017109551743,0,My strategy was to make sure all of them couldn't move around anymore. So if the first one wouldn't move I would leave it there and move to the next one until none of them moved anymore.
153,1,0,Demonstration,0.3622048590262267,1,"start on the left and try to see what the first one will be by moving each one to see if it goes first, once you get the first one in place check each one by clicking the one immediately to the left to see if it swaps, as they quit swapping move to the next selection on the right til all are in place "
176,1,0,Demonstration,0.3613797216222342,6,I started with the first and the last and worked backwards. Most times I double checked once I thought I was done.
202,1,0,Demonstration,0.3510464382991854,1,"Start with the second one.  If it changes, click again.  Then the first.  If it changes, click again. Click 3.

186,1,0,Demonstration,0.3506411892026277,0,I moved them right until I couldn't any more.

218,1,0,Demonstration,0.3451544919804384,0,"Match every item you can between every other item in sequence.  It might not solve it quickest, but a slow solve is better than no solution at all."
273,1,0,Demonstration,0.3418670280815026,3,"I tried to be methodical and logical about it, but it was so easy to lose track of what I'd already tried and that added additional clicks. I think if I'd been keeping better track, it would have helped me. I think in every trial I went from left to right. I ended up basically doing what the highest paid player did, but not nearly as successfully. Just take your time and pay attention, and work methodically."
215,1,0,Demonstration,0.3411489891234368,1,I clicked on the pictures in order until they stopped switching.  I don't think it worked very well.
267,1,0,Demonstration,0.3383223746829532,10,"I learned some strategy from the learning phase. I just compared one  image with the other image one after the other . First I started  from the first image to last image one after the other, then from the backwards."
225,1,0,Demonstration,0.338140589569161,0,I start on the left and click the first one and then the one to the left. I go down the row like that. When I get done with those I randomly click on some in the middle to see if they switch. If they don't I click finished. In the beginning this worked well for me but when I tried mixing it up and trying something different it didn't work as well. If you get a few right don't change your strategy like I did.
264,1,0,Demonstration,0.33722681359045,0,I tried to use the algorithms I was shown by other players. But I forgot the system after about 3-4 sets. I resorted to random clicking. 
271,1,0,Demonstration,0.3287667509336065,0,I tried to make sure I compared each picture with the remaining ones.  Hard to do when they jump around.
179,1,0,Demonstration,0.3186953027978669,1,"I wouldn't recommend my strategy.  I tried to guess sometimes, other times I went with one of the people before me did.  I would love to do this again."
196,1,0,Demonstration,0.3182365345713274,0,I was just going from right to left mostly
180,1,0,Demonstration,0.3159276357601864,0,"I clicked on the first image every time, and compared it to all other images until I found the correct spot for it. I then went down the line and did the same with all images. This did not work as well as I would have liked."
181,1,0,Demonstration,0.3140749157514586,0,I would suggest attempting to move each tile. You will eventually see a pattern. Follow the pattern. 
157,1,0,Demonstration,0.3102106651411513,0,I just tried to go through one by one.

If they switched, I then would used the switched picture and did the same. I worked my way from left to right in this order in a process of elimination. This was not efficient and apparently not a very successful strategy."
259,1,0,Demonstration,0.2974807194034504,0,I started from left to right and tried pairs in one at a time.  Resetting as a piece fell into place.
295,1,0,Demonstration,0.2932717759310557,2,If one image moved towards the front of another I would move to the next image that I hadnt moved. I tried to do this in sequence from left to right

187,1,0,Demonstration,0.2858329195172657,15,It seems that there was a pattern where I need to go from right to left and try two images next to each other every time. Then I make sure that the switches are correct by doing it again.
161,1,0,Demonstration,0.2722314049586777,0,I went from left to right and made adjustments if the images were reordered.

258,1,0,Demonstration,0.2491133217993079,10,I tried to start from the end and put the last one in position first and work my way back to the top

231,1,0,Demonstration,0.2424875845655066,0,I tried to find the number one position and the number six position and then fill in from there.  It didn't always work because I would lose track of what pictures I had checked.

238,1,0,Demonstration,0.1608163265306122,0,I just randomly clicked until it said finished. I simply hated this

205,1,0,Demonstration,0.1281536046371211,0,I tried to observe which ones moved. If they moved I tried to move the image to the optimal spot. 
201,1,0,Demonstration,0.1,0,I looked at all the objects and their materials and tried to pair them together. I also looked at the scenery if the pictures were outdoors. Some items were related to comfort and tried to place those together. 
239,1,0,Demonstration,0.1,0,Since I only got one bonus round correct< I'm not sure if I can recreate what I did. I thinkI changed out each end then worked my way in to the center. then I changed a couple more in the center.

260,1,0,Demonstration,0.0755555555555555,0,I don't have any idea how the game worked. I thought that NOT being able to change pictures means that I had the pictures in the right order. Please don't take my advice. I completely sucked at this game. I only got 1 right out of the 9. That's only 11%.
211,1,0,Demonstration,0.0673372781065088,0,I started of the 2 one on the right and tried moving forward until none would move. It didn't work well and I do not recommend using this strategy.
