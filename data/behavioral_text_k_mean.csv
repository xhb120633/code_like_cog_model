Here is an example (we will use letters instead of pictures):

The correct order of this example will be: ABCDEF with each letter representing a picture.

Say you get a jumbled up order of this: DBCAEF.

Going from the instructions I wrote earlier, first do a comparison between the 2nd option from the left and the leftmost option. This will result in this: BDCAEF

Then try the 3rd option to the 2nd. Which results in: BCDAEF

Then compare the 2nd option to the 1st: BCDAEF . Note that there is no change. You then continue this method.

With the resulting changes being:
BCADEF
BACDEF
ABCDEF

You would then try to move letters ""E"" and ""F"" up.

1 2 3 4 5 6 

I first want to find what is box 1. Once that is known, I then move to box 2 and so on. 

To figure out box 1, you start on the left most box and click each picture in proceeding order. 

So you're first series of moves is always the following: 

1->2
1->3
1->4
1->5
1->6

Note: It does not matter if the picture swaps. You always proceed in that order for the first sequence. I thought of each box as having its own sequence, the purpose of which is to find out what belongs in that box. 

Next, you do the same thing with box two in proceeding order. So, 2->3, then 2->4, etc. You do NOT go backwards. When your first box is settled, it stays there. You never go 2->1.

That is your base strategy. 

Now,since the numbers are not in perfect order, you learn patterns idiosyncratic to that particular round as you play. This is where you deviate from the base strategy and pictures provide shortcuts. An example:

Say I am going through my box 1 sequence. If the picture I select does not swap with box 2 or 3, but does swap with box 4, I now know that the picture on box 4 comes before the pictures on boxes 2 and 3. And so, to save time, I will move the picture on box 4 to box 2 after finishing my box 1 sequence. Again, what was on box 4 is now on box 2. I now know that picture on box 2 will not swap with the pictures on boxes 3 or 4, so I can SKIP those in my box 2 sequence.

1. Try to remember which images were swapped. That will help you avoid unnecessary comparisons.
